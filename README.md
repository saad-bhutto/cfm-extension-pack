The user can define which characters to match, and which colours to use. Super handy!
- [gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - GitLens supercharges Git inside VS Code and unlocks untapped knowledge within each repository. It helps you to visualize code authorship at a glance.
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) - Never worry about formatting your code ever again, keep everything consistent with ease. My suggestion is to add `"editor.tabCompletion": true, "editor.formatOnSave": true,` to your settings file in preferences.
- [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) - Includes support for .vue files, including but not limited to: Syntax-highlighting, Emmet, Linting / Error Checking, Formatting, Auto Completion, Debugging

- [Formatting toggle](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tombonnike.vscode-status-bar-format-toggle&WT.mc_id=marketplace-pack-sdras) This one is a lifesaver! I love Prettier, but there are times I'm submitting PRs to repos with different formatting rules than I have. Rather than having to either shut off Prettier entirely, update my preferences to match theirs, or submit a noisy PR, I can use this extension to toggle formatting with a quickkey and get everything in! I love it.
